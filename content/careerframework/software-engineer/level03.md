# Software Engineer - Senior Software Engineer - Level 3

I independently identify and deliver software solutions through a set of milestones spanning a specific product focus or a multi-component system. 

I have mastered the fundamentals of code fluency and ensure my team produces high-quality code. I have a well-rounded set of software design skills that allow me to build correct, maintainable software components. I am able to decompose business problems into solutions that may require designs with multiple interacting components. I understand the technologies and systems used in my area and how they fit together. I am a true partner to stakeholders, executing against the spirit, not just the letter, of requirements.		

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Code Fluency](/careerframework/softwareengineer#code-fluency) | I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements. <br><br> I ensure high code quality in code reviews. <br><br> I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it. |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/softwareengineer#engineering-maturity) | I consistently choose appropriate levels of engineering. <br><br> I am a practioner and advocate of best practices, and am willing to challenge and concede as appropriate. <br><br> I lead my team's understanding, by demonstrating practices, patterns, approaches and principles. <br><br> I follow the latest industry best practices, and identify and suggest practices, patterns, approaches and principles that may be useful to my team. |
| [Software Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#software-design) | I am able to independently design software components in well scoped scenarios, with simplicity and maintenance as key considerations. My components are testable, debuggable and have logical APIs that are not easily misused. <br><br> I know when to make significant refactors and when it’s better to leave things as-is. <br><br> I have a strong grasp of the libraries, platforms, and systems that I rely on, allowing me to apply them expertly. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#architecture-design) | I’m able to decompose problems or business scenarios into solutions composed of multiple software components interacting with each other. <br><br> I proactively identify issues with technical dependencies of my project that are owned by other teams and surface them. |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/softwareengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |
