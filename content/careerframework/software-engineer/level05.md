# Software Engineer - Graduate/Junior Software Engineer - Level 5

I deliver lots of high quality production-ready code with direction from the team. 

My primary craft focus is on learning the fundamentals of reading and writing code within a large, long-lived codebase, gaining familiarity with the technologies in my area of work, and learning to work against plans and schedules.			

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Code Fluency](/careerframework/softwareengineer#code-fluency) | I translate ideas into clear code, written to be read as well as executed. <br><br> My code is free of glaring errors - bugs are in edge cases or design, not mainline paths - and is well documented and well tested with appropriate use of manual vs automated tests. <br><br> I’m capable of reading and navigating functions and classes/modules that I didn’t write. <br><br> I am learning to tackle coding tasks with high throughput while maintaining appropriately high quality; I optimize for either speed or quality, depending on the explicitly stated needs of my team. |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/softwareengineer#engineering-maturity) | I'm watching more senior team members closely and working on my understanding of why certain practices are used. <br><br> When I come across a new pattern, practice or technique, I take the time to research it and understand its purpose, the problems it solves, and potential alternatives. |
| [Software Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#software-design) | TODO |

| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/softwareengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |
