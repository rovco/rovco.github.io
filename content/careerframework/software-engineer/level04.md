# Software Engineer - Level 4

I am prolific at delivering resilient and sustainable software projects from design to implementation and rollout.

My primary craft focus is consistently delivering high-quality code. I am beginning to develop skills in designing software components and translating product or business requirements into simple projects.			


|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Code Fluency](/careerframework/softwareengineer#code-fluency) | I translate ideas into clear code, written to be read as well as executed. <br><br> My code is free of glaring errors - bugs are in edge cases or design, not mainline paths - and is well documented and well tested with appropriate use of manual vs automated tests. <br><br> I’m able to read and navigate through a large code base and effectively debug others’ code. <br><br> I address code tasks with both high throughput and appropriately high quality for the stage of project I am working on. |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/softwareengineer#engineering-maturity) | I am able to pitch my engineering approach at an appropriate level (in both scale and resiliance) most of the time. <br><br> I have built myself a working knowledge of practices, patterns, approaches and principles. I am applying them daily with the guidance of my team. <br><br> I guide more junior team members on their understanding, by providing a rounded narrative on practices, patterns, approaches and principles, the problem they solve and why the team uses them. |
| [Software Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#software-design) | I’m able to understand the existing designs and technology choices within my area, and I make appropriate adjustments to existing designs when necessary. <br><br> Code modules I write exhibit good separation of concerns. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#architecture-design) | I’m able to decompose a simple problem or business scenario into a solution composed of multiple software components interacting with each other. |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/softwareengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |
