# Software Enginer - Principal Software Engineer - Level 2

I deliver results against a strategic company-level business objective or key component of the Vaarst mission. 

I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and development methodologies, and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. I design systems that are far from my previous experience, anticipating scale and scope beyond the current requirements at Dropbox or in areas otherwise unexplored. I make or participate in discussions around making sweeping technical choices that lack clearly correct answers, but am able to articulate the rationale and technical vision behind those choices. I partner with cross-functional stakeholders to identify major new business opportunities unlocked by technical capabilities.			

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Code Fluency](/careerframework/softwareengineer#code-fluency) | I write code that captures the essential nature of the solution and is appropriately flexible, reusable, efficient, and adaptable to changing requirements. <br><br> I ensure high code quality in code reviews. <br><br> I have a strong awareness of the ecosystem of tools and libraries supporting my primary programming language and development environment and a strong grasp of the idioms and patterns of my language. I may be intimately familiar with the open source community surrounding it. |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/softwareengineer#engineering-maturity) | I consistently choose appropriate levels of engineering. <br><br> I am an expert on and advocate best practices, and am willing to challenge and concede as appropriate. <br><br> I lead my team's understanding, by demonstrating practices, patterns, approaches and principles. <br><br> I follow the latest industry best practices, and identify and lead adoption of practices, patterns, approaches and principles that may be useful to my team. |
| [Software Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#software-design) |I design software components that are difficult to misuse and flexible in the face of an increase in the number of adjacent use cases as appropriate to the direction of the business (neither under nor over-designed). <br><br> I reduce complex designs and concepts to simple foundational components through correct choices of data structures, applications of algorithms, or other deep insight into the problem space and create simple interfaces to complex underlying systems. <br><br> I’m able to review designs in related areas with high quality and ensure quality for cross-team cross-module design/API issues. <br><br> I may have deep expertise in implementation or principles behind some of the libraries, platforms and systems relevant to my team's work. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/softwareengineer#architecture-design) | I can design systems that require research on what is possible rather than relying on my past experience, and where, consequently, a significant portion of the challenge is designing an appropriately staged validation plan. <br><br> I define the high level systems we need to build to meet strategic objectives. |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/softwareengineer#technical-strategy) | I am responsible for making technical choices that have no one clearly correct answer but whose consequences have a sweeping effect across my scope in the organization. <br><br> I rally my organization around those choices by providing a clear rationale and technical vision backing them. |

# Software Engineer - Team Lead - Level 2

I guide a team of ICs to deliver business impact with support from my manager.
