# Career Framework - Software Engineer

This area of the career framework is for the Software Engineer role, focusing on areas of their craft listed below.

## Code Fluency
The ability to read and write code fluently and well.

## Engineering Maturity
TODO

## Software Design
The ability to design software components with reasonable APIs and interaction patterns (writing good classes, modules, etc - building out a box in your architecture diagram).

## Architecture Design
The ability to design systems of interacting components - e.g. a collection of interacting features or the architecture of a product, binary or significant service (what are the boxes in your architecture diagram, how do they interact).

## Technical Strategy
Ensuring the right long-term technical decisions are being made by the organization - knowing what systems to build; making technical choices when there are not clear solutions. What standards apply to all the boxes in the organizations architecture diagrams?
