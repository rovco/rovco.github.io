# Lead/Principal ML and Edge ML Engineer - Level 2

## Craft - All

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [ML Ops](/careerframework/mlengineer#ml-ops) | I implement systems to perform data engineering, version control of data, models and code, continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, automating deployments and experiments, model performance assessment, and model monitoring in production. <br><br> I’m capable of designing systems with significant ambiguity and/or lots of systems that depend on it. <br><br> I critique existing metrics and define new offline and online metrics that stay valid throughout the model’s lifetime. <br><br> I have expert knowledge in one or more areas of cloud technologies, and how they may be leveraged to advance MLOps. |
| [AI Governance](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-governance) | I standardise existing practices into guidance that generalizes to more use cases. <br><br> I investigate supporting technology for governance, such as reporting tools. <br><br> I involve different stakeholders to gain a complete view of potential challenges and opportunities for reliability, safety, trustworthiness, and accountability for our products. |
| [AI Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-strategy) | I formulate business objectives as computational tasks using the right approach for each objective. <br><br> I provide critical feedback to other members of my team through the lifecycle* of an ML project. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/mlengineer#architecture-design) | TODO |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |


## Craft - ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](/careerframework/mlengineer#machine-learning-and-deep-learning) | I am expert in a range of ML techniques, mathematics/statistics and tools and I select an optimal solution for my projects. <br><br> I can analyse and present datasets or results of experiments while choosing the appropriate statistical methods and visualization techniques. I can also evaluate the statistical rigor of my team’s analyses and make appropriate recommendations. <br><br> I maintain strong awareness of the state of the art, and can select an appropriate algorithm, tool, or technique for a given problem, incorporating a broad understanding of various trade-offs.<br><br> I define an experimentation strategy, and adapt my team’s roadmap to reflect significant findings. <br><br> I maintain strong awareness of new technologies and advancements in the ML industry and open source communities,  identify beneficial products, and implement into our existing tech stack. |
