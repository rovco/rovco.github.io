# ML and Edge ML Engineer - Level 4

## Craft - All

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [ML Ops](/careerframework/mlengineer#ml-ops) | I use technologies for code, data and model versioning, environment management (e.g. Git, conda, Poetry, pyenv, Docker, DVC, etc.) and model management (e.g. MLFlow, Weights& Biases) to ensure my work is repeatable, scalable, deployable and enables me to collaborate with others. <br><br> I understand how cloud technologies may be used to scale ML workloads, host, and productionise ML systems. <br><br> I have utilised cloud technology for improving some MLOps capabilities (automation, removing workload limitations, building pipelines, improving data accessibility, automating model retraining, running processes in parallel etc.). |
| [AI Governance](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-governance) | I understand risks from ML such as model bias and model drift, and am able to mitigate them. <br><br> I understand current debates about AI ethics and Fairness, Accountability and Transparency. |
| [AI Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-strategy) | I understand the reasoning behind my team’s decisions, both in terms of the needs of a project and to deliver high-level goals in Vaarst's AI strategy. <br><br> I understand the stages of ML development lifecycle* and their interactions within my projects, and make adjustment to existing designs for any stage when necessary. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/mlengineer#architecture-design) | TODO |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |


## Craft - ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](/careerframework/mlengineer#machine-learning-and-deep-learning) | I understand the ML algorithms and techniques used in my area, and can adapt them to my project as needed. <br><br> I can implement algorithms or methods from academic research. <br><br> I can analyse and present datasets or results of experiments with statistical methods and/or visualization techniques my team may specify for me. |

## Craft - Edge ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Edge Computing](/careerframework/mlengineer#edge-computing) | I am proficient using fundamental languages and environments (e.g. C++, Python, Linux) when working on embedded compute devices (e.g. Nvidia Jetsons). <br><br> I am familiar with optimisation techniques and can work within the constraints of specific hardware. I can use parallelisation and hardware acceleration to speed up application and model execution. <br><br> I can to write performance/benchmarking code and analyse the results. <br><br> I am capable of writing, deploying and debugging on embedded devices. <br><br> I can use the relevant Parallel Computing (e.g. CUDA) and Deep Learning frameworks (e.g. TensorRT, DeepStream, ONNX). <br><br> I am familiar with media and streaming libraries (Gstreamer) and robotics frameworks (e.g. ROS). |
