# Junior ML and Edge ML Engineer - Level 5

## Craft

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [ML Ops](/careerframework/mlengineer#ml-ops) | I work effectively with the ML tools and software packages used by my team. <br><br> I have an awareness of the cloud technologies and how they may be used to scale, host and productionise ML systems.  |
| [AI Governance](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-governance) | I understand risks from ML such as model bias and model drift. |
| [AI Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-strategy) | I understand the reasoning behind my team’s strategic decisions, and am able to verify and debug implementations of the design. <br><br> I understand how my work fits into Vaarst's AI Strategy. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/mlengineer#architecture-design) | TODO |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |


## Craft - ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](/careerframework/mlengineer#machine-learning-and-deep-learning) | I have a theoretical understanding of a range of ML techniques (e.g., deep learning, optimization, regression, ensembles, tree based methods, dimensionality reduction, clustering, Bayesian modelling, etc.), mathematics/statistics (matrices, vectors, tensors, linear algebra, etc.), and tools (sklearn, pytorch, TensorFlow, etc.). <br><br> I work on ML models by adapting existing tutorials/guides for new purposes. <br><br> I can analyse and present datasets or results of experiments, with simple methods. |

## Craft - Edge ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Edge Computing](/careerframework/mlengineer#edge-computing) | I am familiar with fundamental languages and environments (e.g. C++, Python, Linux) when working on embedded compute devices (e.g. Nvidia Jetsons). <br><br> I have a theoretical understanding of parallelisation and hardware acceleration, and how it can speed up applications and models. <br><br> I can understand and work with existing parallel computing solutions used at Vaarst. <br><br> I have an awareness of relevant frameworks (e.g. CUDA, TensorRT, ROS).|
