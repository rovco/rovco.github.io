# Head of ML and Edge ML - Level 1

## Craft - All

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [ML Ops](/careerframework/mlengineer#ml-ops) | I ensure that my team can rapidly iterate on ML components and deploy, with confidence, to production. <br><br> I architect systems that reduce technical friction in moving an ML model into production, in the shortest possible time, with as little risk as possible. <br><br> I make correct technology choices for components needed as part of a larger ML infrastructure, including making build vs buy choices for specific components, and choosing frameworks. <br><br> I ensure ML processes at Vaarst are sufficiently scalable to meet now and future demand. <br><br> I monitor my team's usage of cloud technologies, ensuring efficiency and value for money. |
| [AI Governance](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-governance) | I ensure AI systems at Vaarst are safe, accountable, reliable and trustworthy.<br><br> I engage with broader thinking and practices in AI governance at the level of industry standards and best practices. I recognise where Vaarst may be industry leading, or where there are opportunities/obligations to improve. |
| [AI Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-strategy) | I build and mature machine learning teams, and support delivery of AI strategy. <br><br>I am capable of owning the overall strategy for machine learning, and associated data requirements at Vaarst. <br><br>I propose new business objectives or products that can be powered via ML systems adjacent to existing ones. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/mlengineer#architecture-design) | TODO |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |


## Craft - ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](/careerframework/mlengineer#machine-learning-and-deep-learning) | I have a deep understanding of a range of ML techniques, mathematics/statistics, or tools and I select such solutions that work long-term for my team. <br><br>I track the state of art ML developments in areas related to my team’s work and when beneficial, I incorporate those results into my team’s work. <br><br> I ensure the quality of ML systems my team builds. My analysis goes beyond standard metrics, incorporating concerns such as ethics, privacy, bias, security and maintainability. |

## Craft - Edge ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Edge Computing](/careerframework/mlengineer#edge-computing) | I may have deep expertise in implementation or principles behind some of the libraries, platforms and systems relevant to my team's work. <br><br> I track the state of art Edge ML developments in areas related to my team’s work and when beneficial, I incorporate those results into my team’s work. I ensure the quality of Edge ML systems my team builds. My analysis goes beyond standard metrics, incorporating concerns such as ethics, privacy, bias, security and maintainability.
