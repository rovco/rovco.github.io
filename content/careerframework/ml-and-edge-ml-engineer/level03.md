# Senior ML and Edge ML Engineer - Level 3

## Craft - All

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [ML Ops](/careerframework/mlengineer#ml-ops) | I am able to independently design ML components in well scoped scenarios, with simplicity and maintenance and as key considerations, that not only deliver functionality, but take MLOps goals* into consideration. <br><br> I define and track offline and online metrics in service of business objectives. <br><br> I can make recommendations of the best way to integrate cloud technologies into existing workflows. <br><br> I am an experienced user of cloud technology for machine learning, and use it (as appropriate) for meeting MLOps goals. |
| [AI Governance](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-governance) | I can identify specific risks in ML systems, and flag areas of governance needed that goes beyond existing practices. <br><br> I build structures for reporting, testing and monitoring of metrics related to safety, reliability and trustworthiness as part of my daily practice developing ML systems. |
| [AI Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#ai-strategy) | I can translate a business problem into a spec for a computational task such as classification, ranking, or generation. <br><br> I am proficient in ML development lifecycle* and can design each stage according to the needs of the project. |
| [Architecture Design](/careerframework/mlengineer#architecture-design) | TODO |
| [Technical Strategy](/careerframework/mlengineer#technical-strategy) | TODO |


## Craft - ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](/careerframework/mlengineer#machine-learning-and-deep-learning) | I am familiar with a range of ML techniques, mathematics/statistics and or tools  and I select a right such solution for my project. <br><br> I can implement algorithms or methods from academic research confidently and efficiently, with optimisations where applicable. <br><br> I can analyse and present datasets or results of experiments while choosing the appropriate statistical methods and visualization techniques. <br><br> I maintain awareness of the state of the art, and can select an appropriate algorithm, tool or technique for a given problem. <br><br> I prepare and conduct experiments, analyse the results, and adapt my strategy to reflect significant findings. |

## Craft - Edge ML Engineer

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Edge Computing](/careerframework/mlengineer#edge-computing) | I can implement novel solutions using new/latest Deep Learning and Parallel Computing frameworks. <br><br> I can identify and prioritise performance bottlenecks. I am proficient in optimising code for platform specific hardware. I am proficient using parallelisation and hardware acceleration. <br><br> I can determine appropriate metrics for measuring performance. <br><br> I am proficient in writing, deploying and debugging code on embedded devices. |
