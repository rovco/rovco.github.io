# Lead DevOps Engineer - Level 2

I guide a practice of ICs to deliver business impact with support from my manager. I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and development methodologies, and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. 

I design systems that are far from my previous experience, anticipating scale and scope beyond the current requirements at Vaarst or in areas otherwise unexplored. I make or participate in discussions around making sweeping technical choices that lack clearly correct answers, but am able to articulate the rationale and technical vision behind those choices. I partner with cross-functional stakeholders to identify major new business opportunities unlocked by technical capabilities.			


|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/devopsengineer#engineering-maturity) | I consistently choose appropriate levels of engineering. <br><br> I am an expert on and advocate best practices, and am willing to challenge and concede as appropriate. <br><br> I lead my team's understanding, by demonstrating practices, patterns, approaches and principles. <br><br> I follow the latest industry best practices, and identify and lead adoption of practices, patterns, approaches and principles that may be useful to my team. |
| [Infrastructure and Operations](/careerframework/devopsengineer#infrastructure-and-operations) | I am confident and experienced in designing, automating, deploying and managing infrastructure and software packages for a product. <br><br> I build in appropriate observability and instrumentation to ensure systems are manageable and operable. <br><br> Security is a first class citizen of my designs and implementations. I take a proactive approach to including it within systems designs. <br><br> I appropriately and consistently engineer systems to the right operational level, taking into account reliability, resiliance, elasticity, maintainability, observability, telemetry, financial constraints, and site reliability. <br><br> I design and implement appropriately for the product and target environment. <br><br> All of the above, with a view to leading on mulitple products and areas. |
| [Automation](/careerframework/devopsengineer#automation) | I have a wide range of understanding of the different types of automation to apply in both the SDLC, deployment, release and other product life-cycle related activities. <br><br> I always introduce appropriate automation to support best practice such as IaC, CaC, CI/CD, Feature flags and so on. <br><br> I engage and support the development team in automating development activities such as build, lint, test, deployment and release, as well as ensuring operations management does not introduce too much toil. <br><br> All of the above, with a view to leading on mulitple products and areas. |
| [Software Development](/careerframework/devopsengineer#software-development) | I have a good working knowledge of software engineering best practices, particularly around development methodologies and frameworks supporting value-centric delivery, such as feature toggling, TDD, BDD, TBD, CI/CD, XP, Lean, Agile and so on. I consistently apply these to my work. <br><br> I am fluent with and able to manipulate languages I use for automation. <br><br> I consistently apply coding best practices in my work. <br><br> All of the above, with a view to leading on mulitple products and areas. |
| [Process Design](/careerframework/devopsengineer#process-design) | I take opportunities to automate as much process as is reasonable. <br><br> I regularly inspect, measure and adapt processes to deliver the most value and reduce the waste. <br><br> I ensure that processes supports an autonomy within the team, and I am an enabler rather than a blocker. <br><br> All of the above, with a view to leading on mulitple products and areas. |
