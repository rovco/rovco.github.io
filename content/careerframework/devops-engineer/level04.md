# DevOps Engineer - Level 4

I am prolific at delivering resilient and sustainable processes, security and automtion from design to implementation and rollout 

My primary craft focus is consistently delivering high-quality operations, automation and security. I am beginning to develop skills in designing infrastructure and translating product or business requirements into simple projects.			

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/devopsengineer#engineering-maturity) | I am able to pitch my engineering approach at an appropriate level (in both scale and resiliance) most of the time. <br><br> I have built myself a working knowledge of practices, patterns, approaches and principles. I am applying them daily with the guidance of my team. <br><br> I guide more junior team members on their understanding, by providing a rounded narrative on practices, patterns, approaches and principles, the problem they solve and why the team uses them. |
| [Infrastructure and Operations](/careerframework/devopsengineer#infrastructure-and-operations) | I design, automate, deploy and manage parts of system infrastructure and the software packages on them. I contribute toward larger systems with my team. <br><br> Effectively integrate new areas of systems into existing approaches to observability and instrumentation, improving them where necessary. <br><br> I contribute a security perspective towards decisions in my teams. I bear it in mind when designing systems and processes. <br><br> When I design components I consider reliability, resiliance, elasticity, maintainability, observability, telemetry, financial constraints, and site reliability. <br><br> |
| [Automation](/careerframework/devopsengineer#automation) | I identify opportunities for automation, and apply it. <br><br> I understand the fundamentals of best practice approaches and can apply them with the guidance of my team. <br><br> I engage and support the development team in automating development activities such as build, lint, test, deployment and release. |
| [Software Development](/careerframework/devopsengineer#software-development) | I understand best practice in software engineering and when to apply them, including methodologies, frameworks and value-centric delivery. I am look for opportunities to apply them to my own work. <br><br> I have a good grasp of most languages I use, and am able to work with them effectively. <br><br> Best practices are usually apparent in my work. |
| [Process Design](/careerframework/devopsengineer#process-design) | With the help of my team, I adapt processes to deliver the most value and reduce waste. <br><br> I ensure that processes support an autonomous approach. |
