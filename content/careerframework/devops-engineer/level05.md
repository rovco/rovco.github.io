# Junior DevOps Engineer - Level 5

I make lots of high quality contributions to production-ready processes, security and automtion with direction from the team.

My primary craft focus is on learning the fundamentals of SDLCs, infrastructure, software operability, and reading and writing automation, gaining familiarity with the technologies in my area of work, and learning to work against plans and schedules.

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/devopsengineer#engineering-maturity) | I'm watching more senior team members closely and working on my understanding of why certain practices are used. <br><br> When I come across a new pattern, practice or technique, I take the time to research it and understand its purpose, the problems it solves, and potential alternatives. |
| [Infrastructure and Operations](/careerframework/devopsengineer#infrastructure-and-operations) | I am learning about different infrastructure, how it is deployed and deployed to, and what it means to manage infrastructure in production. I contribute design and automation to parts of systems under the guidance of my team. <br><br> I am learning about appropriate observability and instrumentation, and contibuting to elements of this with the guidance of my team. <br><br> I am building my understanding of security in the left of the process, and am building my awareness of OWASP top 10 and other security considerations, and contributing to the security processes in my team.<br><br> With guidance from my team, I am learning about the considerations when engineering system components such as  reliability, resiliance, elasticity, maintainability, observability, telemetry, and financial constraints. |
| [Automation](/careerframework/devopsengineer#automation) | I can identify opportunities for automation, and with the guidance of my team I apply automation techniques to repitious activities. <br><br> I am constantly learning about the underpinning best practices that I can use to improve quality and efficiency, and introduce automation to support parts of this. <br><br> I work with my team to understand their pain points in the processes caused by toil. With the help of my team I address isolated problems with automation. |
| [Software Development](/careerframework/devopsengineer#software-development) | I am building my knowledge of best practice in software engineering, including methodologies, frameworks and value-centric delivery. With the help of my team, I am look for opportunities to apply them to my own work. <br><br> I am learning the languages I most need to use for automation. I also am learning other languages that my team uses to help me have informed conversations with my team. <br><br> With the help of my team, I apply coding best practices in my work |
| [Process Design](/careerframework/devopsengineer#process-design) | TODO |
