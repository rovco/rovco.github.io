# Principal Computer Vision Engineer

## Craft

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Computer Vision Craft](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#computer-vision-craft) | I have a very wide range of experience of computer vision and detailed knowledge. <br><br> I am able to take on projects with little definition and put in place a clear description and process that will lead to the desired results. <br><br> At conferences, authors can appreciate relevant experience that I might share from a commercial perspective and I can interest them in potential collaborations. |
| [Systems Knowledge](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#systems-knowledge) | I have a good understanding of all of our systems and can work on research lines that will complement and add new features to them. <br><br> I can help align different projects within the team so that they can achieve a common goal. <br><br> I have been to many trials and know about the challenges they present so I can do the majority of the technical planning for a trial.|
| [Research Process](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#research-process) | I advocate for best practices and suggest improvements to help keep CV research to a high standard. <br><br> I lead projects within the team and IUK/type projects for the team. <br><br> I constantly spot areas for improvement within our algorithms but have to prioritise a few key ones at any one time. |
| [Reach](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#reach) | I am key to inter-team collaborations. <br><br> I present CV team projects to the rest of the company and can clearly explain the commercial relevance and company objective in this regard. |
| [Creativity and Research Projects](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#creativity-and-research-projects) | I propose high quality ideas for new projects regularly and help to define them. <br><br> I can propose patentable ideas. <br><br> I have a clear understanding of the value of an idea to the company. <br><br> I regularly interact with sales and product teams to discuss support for research topics. |
| [Suggested Training Courses](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#suggested-training-courses) | Leadership skills. <br><br> With feedback, I know where most of my areas of improvement might be. I keep my own track of my CPD. |
