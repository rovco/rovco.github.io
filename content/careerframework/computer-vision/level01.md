# Computer Vision Team Lead

## Craft

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Computer Vision Craft](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#computer-vision-craft) | I have a very wide range of experience of computer vision and detailed knowledge. <br><br> I am able to take on projects with little definition and put in place a clear description and process that will lead to the desired results. <br><br> At conferences, authors can appreciate relevant experience that I might share from a commercial perspective and I can interest them in potential collaborations. |
| [Systems Knowledge](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#systems-knowledge) | I have a good understanding of all of our systems and can work on research lines that will complement and add new features to them. <br><br> I can help align different projects within the team so that they can achieve a common goal. <br><br> I have been to many trials and know about the challenges they present so I can do the majority of the technical planning for a trial. <br><br> I ensure that the team are gaining experience with different systems to build a broad base of knowledge and experience to work from.|
| [Research Process](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#research-process) | I ensure that the team follow research best practices to keep the team's output to a high standard. <br><br> I organise team activities to promote synergy and cohesion. <br><br> I highlight areas of work where team members can generate demos for promotional activities (marketing or raising the team's profile in-company). <br><br> I have a long list of improvements that could be implemented and hope to tackle them over time as I have to ensure that we are on course and schedule towards company ambitions. |
| [Reach](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#reach) | I represent the face of the team's work to the rest of the company and I can clearly explain the future direction of the company in regard to CV team projects.|
| [Creativity and Research Projects](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#creativity-and-research-projects) | I propose high quality ideas for new projects and take responsibility for making sure they are well defined and appropriately scheduled. <br><br> I promote an environment conducive to new idea and new IP generation. <br><br> I ensure that the team's efforts are aligned to the company goals. <br><br> I understand the various scopes of protection that seeking a patent would afford. |
| [Suggested Training Courses](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#suggested-training-courses) | I suggest courses that would be beneficial but am always willing to hear someone else's suggestions. |
