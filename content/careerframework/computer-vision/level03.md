# Senior Computer Vision Engineer

## Craft

|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Computer Vision Craft](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#computer-vision-craft) | I have experience in numerous areas of computer vision. <br><br> I am able to take on projects with wider scope or that have a less well defined direction, with some assistance. <br><br> I can have insightful conversations with authors at conferences and I can suggest areas of future work that their research might follow. |
| [Systems Knowledge](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#systems-knowledge) | I am able to improve methods in our systems and add new features. <br><br> I have familiarity with almost all of our systems and can coach more junior team members on components new to them. <br><br> I have attended several trials and therefore have hands on experience running our systems live. |
| [Research Process](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#research-process) | I am aware of best practices and draw attention to them when they are not being followed. <br><br> I can always think of several areas that could be improved with respect to our algorithms and implementations. |
| [Reach](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#reach) | I often support inter-team projects. <br><br> I present CV team projects to the rest of the company. |
| [Creativity and Research Projects](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#creativity-and-research-projects) | I propose practical/good ideas for new projects and participate in helping to define them. <br><br> With a small amount of guidance or assistance I can generate patentable ideas. <br><br> I am aware of the novelty in my ideas and consider whether they should be protected. <br><br> I draw from a wide range of sources. <br><br> I respond to requests from sales and product teams regarding technical capability questions and feasibility of new features. |
| [Suggested Training Courses](/careerframework/computervisionengineer#suggested-training-courses) | Project management. <br><br> Advanced programming techniques; e.g. concurrent programming, GPGPU frameworks and techniques. <br><br> I welcome suggestions for training areas.|
