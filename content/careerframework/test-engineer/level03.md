# Senior Test Engineer - Level 3

I scale myself, the teams and products I support through my expertise in testing and test planning and I leverage my expertise to drive effective quality process. 

At this level, I drive medium-to-large projects that could span multiple quarters, potentially across multiple teams and multiple Test Engineers. I drive process improvements within each of the teams that I work with and may take on quality improvement projects that impact the larger organization. I often lead the quality direction of my team.			


|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Testing Fluency](/careerframework/testengineer#testing-fluency) | My testing is informed by knowledge of architecture/implementation of a feature and consistently avoids redundant testing or unnecessary testing. <br><br> My test cases includes thorough edge cases, including those not explicitly called out in the A/Cs (possibly written through the use of code inspection or through boundary testing principles etc…). <br><br> I have a deep understanding of the surface area under test and its integration points and use it to craft highly targeted and accurate test coverage. <br><br> I have deep expertise in one or more types of testing (e.g. frontend, backend, automation, usability, or a specific platform) and some familiarity with other types of testing. <br><br> I can consistently point out non-obvious flaws or under-specified scenarios in a spec. <br><br> I can consistently notice bugs that are not obviously incorrect behavior (e.g. the embedding of incorrect assumptions). <br><br> I can sometimes identify and explain the root cause of bugs in areas where I have domain expertise. <br><br> I provide highly valuable test case review in areas I have some familiarity with. <br><br> I have a basic understanding of test automation, which tests should be automated vs. run manually and  provide basic guidance on how specific tests should be automated (e.g. unit test, end to end test) |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/testengineer#engineering-maturity)  | I consistently choose appropriate levels of engineering. <br><br> I am a practioner and advocate of best practices, and am willing to challenge and concede as appropriate. <br><br> I lead my team's understanding, by demonstrating practices, patterns, approaches and principles.<br><br> I follow the latest industry best practices, and identify and suggest practices, patterns, approaches and principles that may be useful to my team. |
| [Testing Strategy](/careerframework/testengineer#testing-strategy)  | I independently identify high risk areas that I should embed in. I am learning to execute using an engagement model where I provide the right level of impact to projects by varying levels of support. <br><br> I drive and plan testing of projects that could span multiple quarters, potentially across multiple teams and multiple Test Engineers. <br><br> I am able to drive the creation of a quality bar for complex launch reviews with assistance of senior leaders (Product, TL, EM  etc.). <br><br> I am able to propose and advise on reasonable quality metrics for the projects I work on with assistance of senior leaders (Product, Eng TL, EM,  etc.). <br><br> I am able to prioritize test coverage via subtle criteria (e.g. technical component breakdown) or appropriately balancing multiple different criteria. |
| [Quality Assessment](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-assessment)  | I proactively and clearly report status and quality risks to partners and teams for the projects I own, leverage quality metrics, and can effectively distill this data from other Test Engineers and/or Software Engineers. <br><br> I detect and alert the team to important risks they are unaware of and work with the team to develop solutions to those risks. <br><br> I notice up front and compellingly advocate for addressing quality risks on my project (e.g. compressed timelines, untestable components) before they become a problem.|
| [Quality Advocacy](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-advocacy)  | I effectively teach and explain basic Testing Strategy principles to the cross functional members of the development team, enabling them to take on this work for low risk projects with minimal support. <br><br> I provide clarity and principles regarding which bugs should be fixed. <br><br> I show strong customer empathy and use it to argue for improving product flows or experiences that are non-obviously flawed. <br><br> I effectively leverage the data from quality metrics to advocate for customer impacting product improvements.|
| [Quality Process Strategy](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-process-strategy)  | I understand and establish the right quality processes for my team given the challenges they’re facing.<br><br> I notice and appropriately address quality process or testability gaps on a team, including getting buy-in from the team to address these problems. <br><br> I identify and drive to resolution impactful quality process improvements. <br><br> I may drive quality processes across multiple teams, not just the ones I am assigned to. <br><br> I am capable of taking on highly impactful quality-related work that is not being done on the team even if it is beyond the scope of traditional Test Engineer responsibilities. |
