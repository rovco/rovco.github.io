# Graduate/Junior Test Engineer - Level 5

I plan and execute testing of features and report on quality risks to cross-functional stakeholders.

At the entry-level for Test Engineers at Vaarst, I am focused on learning the fundamentals of testing fluency, testing strategy, and quality assessment. 			
			


|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Testing Fluency](/careerframework/testengineer#testing-fluency) | "*I write test cases for a feature that is well-defined (but may not have a formal written spec) and utilizes knowledge of our customers. <br><br> I execute manual “black box” UI testing. <br><br> I identify bugs that are obvious/clearly present. <br><br> My test cases effectively cover positive and negative test cases and include most basic edge cases. <br><br> My bug reports provide sufficient detail so that a developer can investigate further. <br><br> I work with my team to define and prioritize which test cases can and should be automated. |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/testengineer#engineering-maturity)  | I'm watching more senior team members closely and working on my understanding of why certain practices are used. <br><br> When I come across a new pattern, practice or technique, I take the time to research it and understand its purpose, the problems it solves, and potential alternatives.|
| [Testing Strategy](/careerframework/testengineer#testing-strategy)  | I plan and execute testing on small to medium sized features of simple to moderate complexity. |
| [Quality Assessment](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-assessment)  | I report status to cross-functional partners including a basic understanding of quality risks. |
| [Quality Advocacy](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-advocacy)  | I understand who the customers are for the features I work on and the intended impact of the feature on them. |
| [Quality Process Strategy](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-process-strategy)  | TODO |
