# Test Engineer - Level 4

I plan and drive testing for the high risk projects developed by my team(s) and identify and fix simple quality process / education problems improving long term quality.

At this level, I drive testing for small-to-medium sized projects, identify and fix simple quality process issues with assistance as needed from my Team and  explain effective testing and quality process principles to developers enabling them to execute testing related activities.			


|Area          | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Testing Fluency](/careerframework/testengineer#testing-fluency) | My testing is informed by the acceptance criteria, basic knowledge of the architecture, and reasonable assumptions (e.g. frontend vs backend changes). <br><br> I proactively work with subject matter experts to identify test cases that would require domain knowledge (edge cases related to code architecture, test cases around integration points) to ensure my testing is thorough. <br><br> I have familiarity with several types of testing (e.g. frontend, backend, automation, usability, or a specific platform). <br><br> I exhibit good attention to detail and consistently notice bugs that might not be caught by a verification step. <br><br> I provide valuable test case reviews in areas I know well. <br><br> I may be a subject matter expert on testing some part of Vaarst's product functionality. <br><br> I work with my team to define and prioritize which test cases can and should be automated. <br><br> My bug reports contain enough detailed information for developers enabling them to quickly identify the root cause making the bugs more actionable. |
| [Engineering Maturity](/careerframework/testengineer#engineering-maturity)  | I am able to pitch my engineering approach at an appropriate level (in both scale and resiliance) most of the time. <br><br> I have built myself a working knowledge of practices, patterns, approaches and principles. I am applying them daily with the guidance of my team. <br><br> I guide more junior team members on their understanding, by providing a rounded narrative on practices, patterns, approaches and principles, the problem they solve and why the team uses them. |
| [Testing Strategy](/careerframework/testengineer#testing-strategy)  | I work with my Team Lead to identify high risk areas that I will embed within. <br><br> I plan and execute testing of small to medium size projects that span multiple sprints, including estimating and prioritizing QA tasks. <br><br> I prioritize test coverage based on straightforward criteria (e.g. happy path vs. not, number of users on a platform, customer impact, etc..). |
| [Quality Assessment](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-assessment)  | I proactively and clearly report status and quality risks to partners and team for the work that I directly own and I am able to leverage basic quality metrics effectively when doing this. |
| [Quality Advocacy](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-advocacy)  | I teach the basic skills of Testing Fluency to cross functional partners; for developers this improves their ability to test their own code. <br><br> I explain and advocate (with the support of more senior engineers) for established quality process that enable effective quality management to stakeholders (e.g. PM, DM, TL) and developers. <br><br> I proactively engage cross functional partners (e.g. PM ,DM,) to learn more about my customers, and work to resolve quality challenges they see. <br><br> I use my understanding of the customer to provide clear and compelling arguments for fixing or not fixing various bugs. |
| [Quality Process Strategy](/careerframework/testengineer#quality-process-strategy)  | I understand the established Quality Processes that drive effective quality management and I am learning how changes in their execution can impact quality. <br><br> I identify, surface, and fix simple process/testability issues within the team(s) I am supporting with assistance as needed from my Team. |
