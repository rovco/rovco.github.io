| [Strategy](/careerframework/shared#strategy) | I partner with Senior Technology leadership to define a long-term vision for my group that factors in both a deep understanding of what is happening in the business and in the market as well as the technical limitations and possibilities of Vaarst’s software and systems. <br><br> I anticipate challenges and am able to influence the technical direction of the team or org to execute on that vision even in the face of significant misalignment. |
